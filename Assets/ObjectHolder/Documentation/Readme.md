***For the script `Collider` and `Rigidbody` component are required***

### How to do?

To create a holder object, drag-n-drop the `ObjectHolder.cs` script to needed object.

It will create an area in which it will check for the object to hold.

Then, you can control its parameters:

```
- Radius
```
The speed of moving towards center:
```
- Min speed
- Max speed
```
Either should object rotate when it reaches the center or not:
```
- Rotate object
```
